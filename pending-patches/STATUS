darwin/unicast-extensions.diff

	This patch is new as of 2021-07-30 and is very experimental (not
	yet actually tested as part of a Darwin kernel).  It will be
	tested informally by someone Dave knows.

	This patch is against xnu-7195.121.3.

freebsd/subnet_addr.diff

	This patch is new as of 2021-06-09 (updated 2021-06-14 with sysctl
	and 2021-06-15 based on review feedback) and has not been merged yet.

	Mike Karels has made his own variant after some discussion, which is
	now tracked at

	https://reviews.freebsd.org/D31861

freebsd/freebsd_e.diff

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-25.

	It should probably be considered superseded by
	https://reviews.freebsd.org/D19316 (which adds the same
	functionality in a different way).

freebsd/in_zeronet.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-25.

	It should probably be considered superseded by
	https://reviews.freebsd.org/D19316 (which adds the same
	functionality in a different way).

isdn-utils/isdn4k-utils-3.27_20151118.patch

	I'm not sure what would be considered the upstream source for this
	package anymore.  There are a few related projects that appear to
	be almost abandoned.  I could not access the CVS server mentioned
	at https://www.isdn4linux.de/cvs.shtml.

	I think the official upstream might be

	git://git.misdn.eu/isdn4k-utils.git

	which isn't explicitly mentioned on the corresponding web site,
	and which I deduced by analogy to the CVS page.

	There's also a fork of the source at

	https://github.com/marschap/isdn4k-utils

	This patch has not been merged on either of these trees as of
	2020-09-28.  As noted below, the affected code originally came
	from pppd.

iproute2/0001-Use-SCOPE_HOST-default-only-for-127-16-not-127-8.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2021-01-08.

	This patch is meant to be used in conjunction with a Linux kernel
	patch.  It has been tested successfully.

linux/0001-ip.7-Add-special-and-reserved-addresses-section.patch
linux/0001-ip.7-Describe-lowest-host-behavior-change.patch
linux/0001-PATCH-v3-ip.7-Add-Special-and-reserved-addresses-sec.patch

	The first two patches against the man-pages tree are new as of
	2021-03-12 and have not been merged yet.

	The former patch (documenting existing kernel behavior) was
	submitted to linux-man on 2021-03-19, and a revised version based
	on comments was resubmitted on 2021-03-29.

	The third patch combines the former two, on the occasion of the
	release of Linux 5.14, and is meant as an alternative to them.
	It also cites specific commits in which special address behaviors
	were merged in the Linux kernel.  It is new as of 2021-08-30 and
	has not been merged yet.  It was submitted to linux-man on
	2021-08-31.
	
linux/0001-Reduce-local-loopback-network-to-16-updated.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2021-01-08.  It is a more
	comprehensive version of 0002-Reduce-localhost-to-a-16.patch.

	In order to make the loopback network actually shrink to /16, this patch
	requires userspace changes in iproute2 and systemd.

linux/0001-Reduce-multicast-range.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-25.  It is a narrower
	part of the functionality of
	0001-Allow-0.0.0.0-8-and-reduce-localnet-and-enable-225-2.patch.

linux/0002-Reduce-localhost-to-a-16.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-25.  It is a narrower
	part of the functionality of
	0001-Allow-0.0.0.0-8-and-reduce-localnet-and-enable-225-2.patch.
	It has been superseded by 0001-Reduce-local-loopback-network-to-16-updated.patch.

measurement/probe-busybox/0001-Reduce-special-cases-for-IPv4-address-space.patch

	A narrower version of this patch (continuing to exclude all of 224/4
	and 127/8) was adopted by the RIPE Atlas project at the beginning of
	March 2021.

	It will require corresponding changes in the RIPE Atlas backend in
	order to request probes to test reserved address space (since scans
	that specify reserved address targets numerically are blocked from
	doing so by both the probe software and the backend).

openbsd/openbsd_class_e.diff

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-28.  It's closely
	related to, though narrower than, the FreeBSD patch.

openwrt/0001-Reduce-loopback-netmask-netmask-to-16.patch

	This patch is new as of May 3, 2021, and has not been merged yet.  It
	needs testing to double-check that it has the expected effect in
	combination with a patched kernel.

	This is the equivalent in functionality for OpenWrt of the systemd
	patch

	systemd/0001-Change-localhost-prefix-from-8-to-16.patch

ppp/ppp-2.4.7.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-28.  The affected code
	is apparently the origin of the code in isdn-utils (not that
	isdn-utils is likely to be updating its PPP implementation to match
	the original upstream pppd).

	The author of this code is my former Linuxcare coworker.

pureftpd/pure-ftpd-1.0.46.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-28.

	The upstream developer independently made a related change that
	allows the software to use class E addresses, though still not
	class D addresses, on November 21, 2019.

	https://github.com/jedisct1/pure-ftpd/commit/2d7bff38b7b82ba49b3bf73b393c7e43a6e27406

routing/0001-Allow-Class-E-addresses-throughout-FRR.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-25.  The upstream project
	is looking for revisions or actions from us.  See

	https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/pull/3462

routing/0001-bird-treat-former-classe-addresses-as-valid-addresse.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2020-09-25.  I'm not sure whether
	it was submitted to the upstream project or not.  See, e.g.,

	https://gitlab.nic.cz/labs/bird/-/blob/master/lib/ip.c

	(I need to do some more searches to see if this patch was ever
	introduced into the project's Gitlab instance or a mailing list.)

routing/0001-martians_check-remove-all-but-0.0.0.0-32-from-0.0.0..patch

	This is apparently meant to be applied to babeld (the name doesn't
	make that explicit).  This patch has not been merged as of
	2020-09-28.  See, e.g.,

	https://github.com/jech/babeld/blob/master/util.c

systemd/0001-Change-localhost-prefix-from-8-to-16.patch

	This patch has not been merged as of 2021-01-08.

	This patch is meant to be used in conjunction with a Linux kernel
	patch.  In combination with that patch, it lets a Linux system
	come up with 127.0.0.1/16 configured on loopback at boot time, and
	other 127/8 address available for regular unicast routing.
