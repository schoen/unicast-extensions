freebsd/subnet_addr.diff

	Mike Karels made his own variant of this patch after some discussion,
	which is now tracked at

	https://reviews.freebsd.org/D31861

	This is gradually being incorporated into FreeBSD versions,
	starting with 14-current on 2021-09-17.

	https://reviews.freebsd.org/R10:fd0765933c3ccb059ad7456e657b2e8ed22f58b0

	It was merged into main FreeBSD sometime in October 2021, probably
	October 19, 2021.

	https://reviews.freebsd.org/R10:3ee882bf21afec1adca131783468e9091826521a

	I believe that means it will be included in FreeBSD 13 releases that
	occur after that date.  (I'm not sure about FreeBSD 12 releases after
	that date, such as FreeBSD 12.3.)

	Dave further noted that this is one of three accepted patches on
	OpenWrt that completed 240/4 support for OpenWrt 19.01.

	* Backport of Linux 4.20 ifconfig ioctl. Status: ACCEPTED.
	* Removal of IN_EXPERIMENTAL check in netifd. Status: ACCEPTED.
	* Removal of 240/4 from BCP38 package. Status: ACCEPTED.

	(The OpenWrt patch history for the first and last of these is
	apparently not recorded in the Unicast Extensions repository.)
