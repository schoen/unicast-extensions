freebsd/subnet_addr.diff

	Mike Karels made his own variant of this patch after some discussion,
	which is now tracked at

	https://reviews.freebsd.org/D31861

	This is gradually being incorporated into FreeBSD versions,
	starting with 14-current on 2021-09-17.

	https://reviews.freebsd.org/R10:fd0765933c3ccb059ad7456e657b2e8ed22f58b0

	It was merged into main FreeBSD sometime in October 2021, probably
	October 19, 2021.

	https://reviews.freebsd.org/R10:3ee882bf21afec1adca131783468e9091826521a

	I believe that means it will be included in FreeBSD 13 releases that
	occur after that date.  (I'm not sure about FreeBSD 12 releases after
	that date, such as FreeBSD 12.3.)

	This patch was merged in 65cab850f0eea, approved by David S. Miller
	on December 14, 2018.

linux/0001-Treat-IPv4-lowest-address-as-ordinary-unicast-address.patch

        This patch was committed on 2021-05-17.  See

	https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/netdev/net-next.git/commit/net/ipv4?id=94c821c74bf5fe0c25e09df5334a16f98608db90

measurement/probe-busybox/0001-Reduce-special-cases-for-IPv4-address-space.patch

	A narrower version of this patch was merged by Phil Homburg on 2021-11-29.  See

	https://github.com/RIPE-NCC/ripe-atlas-probe-measurements/commit/59475f848b2e55fa14f6c43e62557b97ed005241

	Here are attempts at both ping and traceroute Atlas measurements to
	240.1.2.3:

	https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/48100582/
	https://atlas.ripe.net/measurements/48100585/	

	The ping measurements report simple reachability failures, while
	some of the traceroute measurements show some router hopes before
	failure and others report that the address was "not allowed".  It
	appears that the difference is that hardware probes performed the
	traceroute, while software probes didn't.  We should check whether
	software probes known to be updated to a recent version also refuse
	this task or not (or perhaps if the RIPE Atlas backend is refusing
	to assign the task to a client that is running a software probe?).

openbsd/openbsd_class_e.patch

	This patch was committed on May 5, 2022.  Git commit mirror (CVS is
	official) at commit a96e5a4e7eee0bf74bc3996f6f2e9a55de158edf.

	Related patches by the OpenBSD developers to improve kernel and
	some userspace support for 240/4 and 0/8 were merged on May 6, 2022,
	with git commit mirror ef8f8f938aa6d1ea1347e941d416f4a2c0029c60
	("Relax the limitation of what is an acceptable unicast IP").

openwrt/0001-Support-class-e-addressing-in-netifd.patch

	This patch was committed on December 16, 2018.  See

	https://git.openwrt.org/?p=project/netifd.git;a=commitdiff;h=cd089c52de96e47cf99410f66701e04e24155b9a

	Dave further noted that this is one of three accepted patches on
	OpenWrt that completed 240/4 support for OpenWrt 19.01.

	* Backport of Linux 4.20 ifconfig ioctl. Status: ACCEPTED.
	* Removal of IN_EXPERIMENTAL check in netifd. Status: ACCEPTED.
	* Removal of 240/4 from BCP38 package. Status: ACCEPTED.

	(The OpenWrt patch history for the first and last of these is
	apparently not recorded in the Unicast Extensions repository.)
