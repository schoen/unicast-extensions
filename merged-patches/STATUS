measurement/probe-busybox/0001-Reduce-special-cases-for-IPv4-address-space.patch

	A narrower version of this patch (continuing to exclude all of 224/4
	and 127/8) was adopted by the RIPE Atlas project at the beginning of
	March 2021.

	It will require corresponding changes in the RIPE Atlas backend in
	order to request probes to test reserved address space (since scans
	that specify reserved address targets numerically are blocked from
	doing so by both the probe software and the backend).
